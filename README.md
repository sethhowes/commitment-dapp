# DOPA 👟🏃
## What is DOPA?
DOPA allows you to stake tokens against the completion of a run. If you don't complete the run by the specified date, your stake gets burned 🔥.

 You can also accept running challenges from anyone else with a crypto wallet. A friend can challenge you to run a certain distance and a certain duration, and raises an amount against this challenge. If you accept the challenge, you match their stake. If you run, you get your friend's and your own funds. However if you don't, your friend gets both.
